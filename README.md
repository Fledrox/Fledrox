Hi, I'm fled! I do digital drawing, 3D modelling and game art. I make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too.

Lang skills I guess are GDScript, CSS, JS. I wanna learn Kotlin one day because it is epic and based.

I use KDEÂ Plasma on Linux because Gnome is as customizable as a plastic toy computer.

I like videogames and my faves are Trackmania, Minecraft, Terraria and Zelda Breath of the Wild.
