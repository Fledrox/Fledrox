Hi, I'm fled! I do digital drawing, 3D modelling and game art. I make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too.
This GH profile is mainly for my website although I originally created it for my Discord bot. I'm not much of a professionnal software engineer, but I do find coding and software in general cool and interesting.

My "programming languages" "skills" are GDScript, CSS, JS

I love customizability, I run Kubuntu on my PC (which has KDEÂ Plasma) and I browse with Vivaldi.

My favorite video games are Trackmania, Minecraft, Terraria and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
