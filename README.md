Hi, I'm fled! I do digital drawing, 3D modelling and game art. I make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too.

My "programming languages" "skills" are GDScript, CSS, JS

I run a PC with Kubuntu, and I love Plasma's customizability. Definitely better for me than its dumbed down brother Gnome.

I like videogames and my faves are Trackmania, Minecraft, Terraria and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
