Hi, Iâ€™m Fledrox.

I like architecture, 3D modelling, art and programming.

I'm waiting to enter architecture school, and I'm learning all of above by myself along with the Japanese language.

The current code I'm working on is a Discord bot in Node.js.

You can contact me either to Fledrox#1337 (expect my tag to change) or at https://discord.gg/8tQ6cPd in the lounge channel (or in DMs).


Have a funday
