# Hiya I'm Fled 

I can draw, do 3D assets, make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too. I use Arch btw :3

This Github was for my unused Discord bot and hosts my personal website.

My "programming languages" "skills" are: GDScript(Godot), Lua(Roblox), CSS, JS.

Please check out my site! It has a more general bio of me on there.
