Hi, I'm fled! I do digital drawing, 3D modelling and game art. I make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too. I use arch btw hahahaha i can finally say the funny sentence
This GH profile is mainly for my website although I originally created it for my Discord bot. I'm not much of a professionnal software engineer, but I do find coding and software in general cool and interesting.

My "programming languages" "skills" are GDScript, CSS, JS

I love customizability, I run Kubuntu on my main PC (which has KDEÂ Plasma) and I browse with Vivaldi. I recently installed Arch Linux with AwesomeWM on my old high school laptop. It's not that hard honestly (at least with archinstall).

My favorite video games are Trackmania (the whole franchise), Minecraft, Terraria and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
