Hi, I'm fled! I do digital drawing, 3D modelling and game art. I make games in Godot and do web dev for fun too.
This GH profile is mainly for my website although I created it for my Discord bot methinks. I'm not much of a pro dev although I find coding and software in general cool and interesting.

My "programming languages" "skills" are GDScript, CSS, JS

My main concern is customizability. That's why my DE is Plasma (I use Kubuntu on my PC) and my browser is Vivaldi.

I like videogames and my faves are Trackmania, Minecraft, Terraria and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
