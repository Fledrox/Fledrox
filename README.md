Hi, Iâ€™m @Fledrox.

I like architecture, 3D modelling, art and programming.

I'm waiting to enter architecture school, and I'm learning all of above by myself along with Japanese.

The current code I'm working on is a Discord bot in Node.js.

You can contact me either to Fledrox#5236 or at https://discord.gg/8tQ6cPd in the lounge channel (or in DMs).


Have a funday
